# Code in Motion

Code in Motion, also known as `cim`, manages multi-repository SDK workspaces and makes it possible to bundle everything needed to setup, build and work with software projects of any size. With the concept of "manifests", it also allows to create dedicated manifest gits for all sorts of projects and purpose. A company can for example, put all their manifests at an internal only git, which allows them to have a single source and entrance point for all their SDKs and software projects. At the same time, they might have external facing manifests for customers and partners, which can be public or private.

Setting up and building an entire project takes just a handful of commands, typically around 5 lines in a shell. The tool standardizes build targets across projects (sdk-xyz commands), so teams don't need to learn different conventions for each software project. Still, advanced users can continue working with the underlying build systems directly if and when needed. The defaults just make the common case easy. `cim` minimizes duplication by letting you share toolchains, workspace components, and git mirrors across multiple projects. Since it is built as a CLI, it works with CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions out of the box. The goal is to deliver production-ready software projects either as standalone projects or in the form of SDKs, both that avoid the struggle with tooling.

This `README.md` is the technical documentation for `cim`. For a more high level overview, the motivations and FAQ, please check the [https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/cim](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/cim) website.

## What Problems Does This Solve?

- **Automated setup**: Replace manual README instructions and copy-paste command workflows with a single init command
- **Repository synchronization**: Clone and update multiple git repos to exact commits specified in a manifest
- **Toolchain management**: Download and extract cross-platform toolchains with OS/architecture filtering
- **Reproducible builds**: Makes it possible to lock all dependencies to specific versions for consistent environments
- **Offline operation**: Mirror repos and artifacts locally, to save bandwidth, disc space and setup time
- **Workspace isolation**: Everything lives in the workspace folder except host OS dependencies and the shared mirror - no scattered files across your system. Deleting the workspace, deletes it all.

## Installation

### Requirements

**Required:**
- make
- tar and unzip
- python3 3.8+, venv and pip
- curl or wget

On Ubuntu for example, you can install those dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt install -y make tar unzip python3 python3-pip python3-venv curl wget
```

**Optional:**
- git 2.0+ (for manual git operations in the workspace; cim uses
  libgit2 internally and does not require the git binary)
- [Rust 1.56+](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) (to build from source)
- Docker (for containerized development)

### Download Precompiled Binary

`cim` is distributed as a single binary (no installer needed). Download the [latest release](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/cim/releases) for your platform from GitHub and place it in a directory on your PATH.

```bash
tar -xzf cim-*.tar.gz
chmod 711 cim
cp cim $HOME/.local/bin/
# or
cp cim $HOME/bin/
# or
sudo cp cim /usr/local/bin/
# or to a PATH similar in Windows.
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/cim.git
cd cim
cargo build --release
```

Binary location: `target/release/cim`

#### Install

```bash
cargo install --path dsdk-cli
```

Or copy to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
cp target/release/cim ~/.local/bin/
```

---

## Quick Start

Manifests define SDK targets and are stored locally (e.g., `~/devel/cim-manifests`) or fetched from git repositories.

### List Available Targets

As of now we host a public manifest repository here [https://github.com/joabech/cim-manifests](https://github.com/joabech/cim-manifests) with a various open source and Analog Devices specific targets. This URL will likely move to a different location in the future. In the meantime, you are welcome to contribute to this repository with new targets and improvements to existing ones.

```bash
cim list-targets
cim list-targets --source https://github.com/<path-to-a>/cim-manifests
cim list-targets -t optee-qemu-v8  # show versions
```

### Initialize a Workspace

```bash
cim init -t optee-qemu-v8
```

Creates workspace at `$HOME/dsdk-optee-qemu-v8`. Use `-w` or `--workspace` to specify a different location.

### Build and Test

```bash
cd ~/dsdk-optee-qemu-v8
cim install toolchains   # install toolchains defined in the manifest
cim makefile             # generate Makefile
make sdk-build           # build
make sdk-test            # test
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Concepts

**Workspace**: A directory with sdk.yml, os-dependencies.yml, python-dependencies.yml, cloned git repos, and a .workspace marker file. Workspaces are isolated.

**Mirror**: Local cache at `$HOME/tmp/mirror` (configurable) for offline operation. Stores downloaded toolchains, files and repo mirrors. Possible to opt out of mirroring with `--no-mirror` or disable in user config.

> **Mirror dependency warning**: Workspaces initialized from a mirror borrow git
> objects from it via git alternates (`.git/objects/info/alternates`). This
> means the workspace git history depends on the mirror being present. Your
> working tree files and any commits you have made locally are always safe, but
> git operations that traverse history (`git log`, `git checkout <old-sha>`,
> `git diff HEAD~N`) will fail if the mirror is removed.
>
> If the mirror is accidentally deleted, re-running `cim update` restores it
> and the workspace recovers automatically — no data is lost.
>
> If you really want to make a workspace fully self-contained and independent
> of the mirror, run the following inside each git repository in the workspace:
>
> ```bash
> git fetch --unshallow
> ```
>
> This copies all borrowed objects from the mirror into the workspace itself.
> From that point the workspace no longer needs the mirror for git operations.

**Target**: Predefined SDK configuration in a manifest repository under `targets/<name>/sdk.yml`.

### Common Commands

#### list-targets

Show available SDK targets from manifest repo.

```bash
cim list-targets [--source URL|PATH] [--target NAME]
```

#### init

Initialize workspace from target.

```bash
cim init --target NAME [--workspace PATH] [--version VERSION]
          [--match REGEX] [--install] [--full] [--symlink] [--no-mirror]
```

- `--install`: Install toolchains and pip packages after init
- `--full`: Complete setup including OS dependencies (requires sudo)
- `--symlink`: Install to mirror with symlinks in workspace
- `--match REGEX`: Only clone repos matching pattern
- `--no-mirror`: Disable mirroring for this workspace

#### update

Update git repos in workspace.

```bash
cim update [--match REGEX] [--no-mirror]
```

#### makefile

Generate Makefile from sdk.yml (run from workspace). Emits standard
`sdk-*` targets (`sdk-build`, `sdk-test`, `sdk-clean`, `sdk-flash`,
`sdk-envsetup`) and a target per git repository. Per-git build
fragment files (`<name>.mk`) are auto-discovered from the directory
set by `build_folder` (default: `build/`) and added as `-include`
directives automatically.

```bash
cim makefile [--no-dividers]
```

To suppress auto-discovered per-git `build/<name>.mk` fragments for
specific repositories, add an `exclude` list to the `makefile_include`
key in `sdk.yml` for that target:

```yaml
# sdk.yml — suppress build/qemu.mk and build/trusted-services.mk
makefile_include:
  files:
    - include extra.mk   # optional explicit includes
  exclude:
    - qemu
    - trusted-services
```

The `files` key lists explicit `-include` directives to emit verbatim;
`exclude` names the repositories whose auto-discovered fragments are
omitted.  Both keys are optional.  The legacy bare-list form
(`makefile_include: [include extra.mk]`) remains supported and implies
no exclusions.

#### foreach

Run command in each repo.

```bash
cim foreach "COMMAND" [--match REGEX]
# Example: cim foreach "git status"
```

#### add

Add git repo to workspace config.

```bash
cim add --name NAME --url URL --commit COMMIT
```

#### install

**os-deps** - Install system packages from os-dependencies.yml

```bash
cim install os-deps [--yes] [--no-sudo] [--yes]
```

**pip** - Install Python packages from python-dependencies.yml

```bash
cim install pip [--profile PROFILE] [--symlink] [--force]
# Example: cim install pip --profile dev,docs
```

**toolchains** - Download and extract toolchains from sdk.yml

```bash
cim install toolchains [--symlink] [--force]
```

**tools** - Install SDK components via install section

```bash
cim install tools [NAME] [--all] [--list]
```

#### docs

**create** - Aggregate documentation from repos

```bash
cim docs create [--force] [--theme THEME] [--symlink]
```

**build** - Build documentation

```bash
cim docs build [--format html|pdf|epub]
```

**serve** - Serve docs locally

```bash
cim docs serve [--port PORT]
```

#### release

Create release tags.

```bash
cim release --tag TAG [--include PATTERNS] [--exclude PATTERNS] [--dry-run]
```

#### config

Manage user configuration.

```bash
cim config [--list] [--get KEY] [--create] [--edit] [--validate]
```

Config location: `~/.config/cim/config.toml` (Unix/Linux/macOS) or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\cim\config.toml` (Windows)

#### utils

Utility commands for manifest maintenance.

**hash-copy-files** - Compute and update SHA256 hashes for copy_files
entries in sdk.yml

```bash
cim utils hash-copy-files [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--add-missing]
```

**hash-toolchains** - Compute and update SHA256 hashes for toolchain
archives already present in the local mirror

```bash
cim utils hash-toolchains [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--add-missing]
```

**sync-copy-files** - Re-run copy_files to sync files to workspace

```bash
cim utils sync-copy-files [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--force]
```

**update** - Self-update cim binary

```bash
cim utils update
```

### Configuration File

`cim config -c` will create it for you. Here are a few example settings you can customize, for a complete list, generate the file and check the comments.

```toml
# Override default manifest source
default_source = "https://github.com/<a-path-to>/cim-manifests"

# Override mirror location
mirror_path = "/custom/mirror"

# Workspace naming prefix (default: "dsdk-")
workspace_prefix = "sdk-"

# Additional documentation directories
documentation_dirs = "wiki, manual, reference"

# Certificate validation: "strict" (default), "relaxed" (insecure), "auto"
cert_validation = "strict"
```

### Certificate Validation

By default, cim validates TLS certificates when downloading files. By default we use strict checking. If errors are seen related to certificates, then the less secure "relaxed" mode can be used as a workaround."

```bash
# Per-command override
cim install toolchains --cert-validation=relaxed  # INSECURE

# Or set in config.toml
cert_validation = "auto"  # try strict, fallback to relaxed with warning
```

Use `relaxed` mode only in trusted networks. It disables certificate validation and is vulnerable to MITM attacks.

---

## Manifest

The `sdk.yml` manifest defines repositories, build targets, toolchains, and
variables for an SDK target. The `os-dependencies.yml` defines the host OS
packages and the python-dependencies.yml defines the Python packages needed
(if any).

### Example

Note that this example, isn't a complete manifest, but rather a demonstration of the different sections and features. See the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section for a public facing manifest repository with various targets.

#### sdk.yml
```yaml
################################################################################

# Possible to opt-out of mirroring with --no-mirror or disable in user config.
################################################################################
mirror: $HOME/tmp/mirror


################################################################################
# Manifest variables — optional key-value pairs that can be reused across
# the manifest with ${{ VAR }} syntax.
#
# Values may reference host environment variables using the standard $VAR
# syntax; these are resolved when cim loads the manifest.
#
# Affected fields: git URLs, toolchain name/url/destination, and
# copy_files source/destination.
#
# Variables are also emitted in the generated Makefile as "VAR ?= value"
# (weak assignments), so host environment variables or command-line
# overrides ("make VAR=other") always take precedence.
#
# In build/test/clean and per-repo build commands, ${{ VAR }} is rewritten
# to $(VAR), so Make expands the variable at recipe time rather than at
# manifest load time.
#
# Unresolved ${{ VAR }} references are left unchanged and a warning is
# printed, making mistakes visible rather than silently ignored.
################################################################################
variables:
  SDK_BASE_URL: https://artifacts.example.com/sdk  # literal base URL

# Build related commands, these will end up in the Makefile generated by "cim
# makefile". Although there is no limit on the amount of commands here, it's
# recommended to keep it minimal and simple, and put more complex logic in a
# dedicated "build.git" or similar. This is mostly meant to initiate and
# redirect build commands to the different build systems used in the workspace.
#
# Each section (envsetup, build, test, clean, flash) supports two formats:
#
# Object format with optional depends_on:
#   build:
#     commands:
#       - $(MAKE) -C build all $(MAKEFLAGS)
#     depends_on:
#       - sdk-envsetup   # run sdk-envsetup before sdk-build in the Makefile
#
# Legacy list format (still works, but no recommended, use the above)
#   build:
#     - $(MAKE) -C build all $(MAKEFLAGS)
#
# depends_on accepts sdk-* target names (sdk-envsetup, sdk-build, sdk-test,
# sdk-clean, sdk-flash) or git repository target names. This is a Makefile
# build-time dependency only — it does not affect git clone ordering.
# Clone ordering is controlled by git_depends_on in the gits section.
#
# Note that there is no requirement on using continue to "make" and tradtional
# Makefiles from here. You can use any build system you want, as long as you
# redirect to it from the high level makefile targets defined here.
################################################################################

#### os-dependencies.yml
Here we define the host OS dependencies for different OS'es. If the distros use the same package names, we can use YAML anchors to avoid duplication (as seen in the example below). This is the source when running `cim install os-deps`. Here `cim` will detect the host OS and distro and then run the corresponding command with the corresponding packages. Note that `cim` will ask for sudo permissions to install the packages on Linux systems. There are also commands to opt out from the sudo requirement (`--no-sudo`) and to run the installation with `--yes` to avoid the interactive confirmation, something that can be useful in CI environments.

`command:` is the command to install packages for that particular OS/distro. For example, `apt install` for Ubuntu and `dnf install` for Fedora, `brew install` for macOS, `winget` for Windows etc.

`packages:` is the list of packages to install for that particular OS/distro.

```yaml
# Common package lists using YAML anchors for DRY
ubuntu_packages: &ubuntu_pkgs
  - build-essential
  - curl
  - git
  - ninja-build
  - python3
  - vim

fedora_packages: &fedora_pkgs
  - ccache
  - cmake
  - curl
  - gcc
  - gcc-c++
  - git
  - boost-devel
  - python3
  - vim

# Linux x86_64 (Intel/AMD) dependencies

    command: "dnf install"
    packages: *fedora_pkgs

# Linux ARM64 (Apple Silicon, ARM servers) dependencies

macos:
  macos-any:

      - automake
      - ccache
      - cmake
      - gcc
      - git
      - python@3.14
```

#### python-dependencies.yml
Here we define the Python dependencies and packages needed for the project. Everything defined in here will end up in the `<workspace>/.venv` folder after running `cim install pip`. As can be seen in the example below, we can define different profiles for different purposes. If you don't specify a profile when running the install command, the `default` profile will be used. You can also specify multiple profiles at the same time using the `-p` or `--profile` option.

```yaml
profiles:
  # Minimal profile - no additional packages
  minimal:
    packages: []

  # Documentation profile - packages for building and serving docs
  docs:
    packages:
      - sphinx
      - sphinx-rtd-theme
      - myst-parser
      - sphinx-autobuild

  # Development profile - docs + development tools
  dev:
    packages:
      - sphinx
      - sphinx-rtd-theme
      - myst-parser
      - sphinx-autobuild
      - pytest
      - black
      - flake8

  # Full profile - everything
  full:
    packages:
      - sphinx
      - sphinx-rtd-theme
      - myst-parser
      - sphinx-autobuild
      - pytest
      - black
      - flake8
      - mypy
      - pre-commit

# Default profile to use when none specified
default: docs
```

## Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# List available targets
cim list-targets

# Initialize workspace
cim init --target optee-qemu-v8 --workspace ~/optee

# Install dependencies and toolchains
cd ~/optee
cim install os-deps --yes
cim install toolchains
cim install pip

# Generate Makefile and build
cim makefile
make sdk-build
make sdk-test
```

The same example, but using `--install` which runs the individual install automatically after setting up the workspace.

```bash
# List available targets
cim list-targets

# Initialize workspace
cim init --target optee-qemu-v8 --workspace ~/optee --install

# Install dependencies and toolchains
cd ~/optee
make sdk-test
```

### Custom Manifest

```bash
# Create manifest structure
mkdir -p my-manifests/targets/my-sdk

# Create sdk.yml
cat > my-manifests/targets/my-sdk/sdk.yml << 'EOF'
mirror: $HOME/tmp/mirror

build:
  - make -j$(nproc)

gits:
  - name: myproject
    url: https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git
    commit: main
EOF

# Initialize from custom manifest
cim init --target my-sdk --source ./my-manifests
```

---

## Experimental Features

### Docker

The `docker create` command generates Dockerfiles for containerized SDK development. The feature is experimental and command options may change in future versions. Since it need cross compiled `cim` binaries for the target, this command can and should only be used from the source code folder of `cim` itself.

```bash
# Generate Dockerfile
cim docker create --target optee-qemu-v8 --distro ubuntu:22.04

# Build and run
docker build -t sdk-dev .
docker run -it sdk-dev bash
```

Options:
- `--distro`: Linux distribution (e.g., ubuntu:22.04, fedora:42)
- `--profile`: Python profile for documentation tools
- `--force-https`: Convert git URLs to HTTPS (useful for corporate proxies)
- `--match`: Filter repositories by regex pattern
